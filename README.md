# Continuous-Time-Transformer-For-Channel-Prediction
The pytorch implementation of our paper “Continuous-Time Transformer Based Channel Prediction with Non-Uniform Pilot Pattern”.

**Note:** For protection purposes, we do not provide runnable code files at this stage. Upon major acceptance of our paper, we will promptly release the full runnable code to facilitate reproducibility.

## Trained model and test data set download
